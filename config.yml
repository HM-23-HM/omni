  chunksThenInstruction: |
    I'm going to send you a series of chunks and then an instruction to execute on the combined chunks.
    The chunks will begin with a header like "CHUNK <number>"
    When you receive the chunks, append them to the previous chunk. Your response should only be "Chunk <number> received".
    The combined chunks will be referred to as "content"
    The instruction will be sent once all the chunks have been uploaded. The instruction should be executed on the "content"
    If you understand, simply respond with the number 7.
