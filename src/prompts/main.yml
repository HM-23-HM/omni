          - priority (type: number)
          - link (type: string)        
          The link should be the full URL to the article.

          The priorities should be in descending order. 
          The highest priority should be 1.
          The headlines should be followed by the date of the article in the format YYYY-MM-DD.

          If there is any development that is highly relevant to the stock market or to the real estate market, then it should be included in the summary.
